### Challenge 1

One player rolls two dices. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The values that the player obtains.

dice 1 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
dice 2 the same.
so when you roll both dice there will be 36 different oucomes based on the combination for each {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ...(6,5), (6,6)}.

B. The sum of the values obtained.
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12.

C. The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices.
12 (6 and 6)


Describe the following events:

Case A: Both values are greater than 5.
the result is 12 - one dice gives 6 and the second gives 6.

Case B: The sum of values is even.
So the outcome is one of these: 2 {(1,1)}, 4 {(1,3),(3,1),(2,2)}, 6{(1,5),(5,1),(2,4),(4,2),(3,3)}, 8 (7 combinations), 10{(5,5),(4,6),(6,4)} or 12{(6,6)}.


Case C: The maximum is the value of both rolls.
12? 6 and 6.

### Challenge 2
One player picks two cards from a poker deck. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The number of figures he picks.
there are 12 figures in 52 cards deck (3 figures per suit). so there is a 12/52 probability of getting a figure.

B. The sum of card values. Consider that the value of figures is 10 and the value of aces is 15.
first card: {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15}.
second - the same options.
So the sum could be any of these: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,30.

C. The number of hearts or spades he picks.
Each suit contains 13 cards, so there are 26 cards which are hearts or spades. For first card it's 1/2 probability that he picks one of these suits.
For the second it's 25 or 26/51 depending of the first card.


Describe the following events:

Case A: The number of figures in the cards the player picked is two.
so their value is 10 and the sum is 20 either way.

Case B: The sum of card values is 17.
The options are: (2,ace),(7,10),(7,figure), and vice versa.

Case C: The value of both cards is less than 8.
The options are (2,5),(3,4),(5,2),(4,3).

### Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The score of player A.
{1,2,3,4,5,6} 

B. The greatest score. 6 for each player

C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.". 1 coin or no coins if there is a tie.

D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.". from 1 to 5 coins depending on the actual results


Describe the following events:

Case A: The score of player A is 2.
then the score of player B still can be any in the range from 1 to 6, but to win he needs to get 3,4,5 or 6.

Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
Then player A got 1 or 2 and the player B .

Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe: 

Player A wins at least 4 coins. Player A has 5 and Player B has 1 or Player A has 6 and Player B has 2.

Player A loses more than 2 coins. Then Player B got 4 and Player A got 1 OR Player B got 5 and Player A got 1 or 2 OR Player B got 6 and Player A got 1,2 or 3.

Player A neither wins nor loses coins. Then there is a tie.
