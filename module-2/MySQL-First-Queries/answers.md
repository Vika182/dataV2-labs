\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf2 They are most rated, so they can be most popular, i.e. most downloaded, but not for sure.  It doesn\'92t mean that they are the best, because rating can be both high and low.

\f0\b \cf2 8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf2 It doesn\'92t mean that these apps are most downloaded or popular. It\'92s just that among all they received the highest score. We don\'92t know anything about the number of rates, it can be very few people who rated that app. But almost all of them rated it with the highest possible score.\
So I made an update and added the ordering by number of rates as well, so we have a list of best apps (that we can say for sure) - they have the highest score and they were rated most.

\f0\b \cf2 9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\f1\b0\fs24 \cf2 No repetitions! So the apps with the highest ratings are not most rated, i.e. not most downloaded or popular. So if your app is good it can be still unknown :)

\f0\b \cf2 11. Do people care about the price of an app?
\f1\b0 \'a0Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf2 To be honest, I don\'92t think we can answer the question as we don\'92t have the number of downloads. If we had, we could look at the percentage of paid apps among the most downloaded ones and then decide.
\fs32 \

\fs24 Most rated != most downloaded, because many people usually don\'92t rate.\
I don\'92t think there is much correlation between rating and \'abcaring\'bb about price. \
Although, If we put it in order descending by the number of rates, we see this app on the 12th position:\
Fruit Ninja Classic	1.99	698516\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa320\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \outl0\strokewidth0 So many people paid the price and rated it, even though it was not free. }
